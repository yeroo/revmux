## Executor — supervised subprocesses

Every rule below was learned by running these CLIs under supervision in anger.
They read like trivia until one of them bites, and each one costs a debugging session to rediscover.

### Verified `claude` CLI behavior

Measured directly against the real CLI. Do not re-derive, and do not assume any of it from documentation.

- `--json-schema` works together with `--output-format stream-json`.
  The model is forced through a `StructuredOutput` tool call,
  and the terminal `result` event carries a **pre-parsed `structured_output` object** alongside the raw `result` string.
  Read `structured_output`. Never scrape JSON out of prose, and never parse the `result` string when the object is present.
- **`--json-schema` takes the schema JSON itself as the argument value, never a path to a file holding it.**
  Passing a path fails immediately with `--json-schema is not valid JSON: JSON Parse error: Unrecognized token '/'`,
  and since a failed launch writes nothing to stdout, it looks exactly like an agent that produced no findings.
  `Request.Schema` therefore goes in as `string(req.Schema)`.
- The stream carries a typed `rate_limit_event`:
  `{"type":"rate_limit_event","rate_limit_info":{"status","resetsAt","rateLimitType","overageStatus"}}`.
  Use it. It is strictly better than matching error strings.
- The `result` event also carries per-model `usage`, `ttft_ms` and `permission_denials`.
  Read the token counts off `usage` — never estimate or recompute them.
- **`permission_denials` must be reported, and it is the one field whose absence is silent.**
  Each entry is `{tool_name, tool_use_id, tool_input}` — `tool_input.command` for a Bash denial.
  A refused tool call does not fail the agent: it writes a sentence in its own prose
  ("Bash is denied in this mode, so I'll work from the files directly") and continues with less,
  so the review narrows to whatever the permission layer allowed and still returns a full-looking
  report. Unread, the only trace is that sentence in one agent's scrollback.
  It goes out as `EventInfo`, for the same reason the codex banner does — it must not release the
  stagger gate. See `.claude/rules/pipeline.md`.
- **`--model` can be silently ignored.**
  A run with `--model haiku` actually executed `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
  Always read the model back from `modelUsage` in the result event and report what actually ran.
  A roster full of per-agent model pins is a claim, not a fact, until it is verified this way.
- **`--json-schema` makes the model silent unless the prompt asks otherwise, and that has to be asked for.**
  The schema forces every conclusion through a `StructuredOutput` tool call, so a review agent's text
  blocks come back all but empty and the run log is a wall of tool names with no sign of what is being
  investigated. Its thinking is no substitute: the blocks arrive with `thinking` empty and only a
  `signature`, so the plaintext never reaches the CLI at all. Text blocks are the only channel that
  carries what the agent is doing — `--include-partial-messages` streams bytes through the emit, but
  they are the answer being written, not commentary on it.
  Measured on one task with one schema, run twice: bare, 2 text blocks against 8 tool calls; with the
  narration instruction appended, 7 text blocks against 7 tool calls, same 8 findings. It costs
  nothing and it is the only way to get a claude agent to say what it is doing.
  That is `ClaudeNarrationContract`, appended by the executor and exported so the archive records it —
  the same shape and the same reason as `CodexOutputContract`. Codex needs none of it; its reasoning
  arrives in the rollout.
- Even a trivial call carries substantial input tokens — system prompt, project instructions, skills listing.
  Worth reporting per agent, which is all revmux does with it.

### Flags every claude invocation carries

```
claude --print --output-format stream-json --verbose
       --model <m> --effort <e>
       --permission-mode auto
       --tools=Bash,Read,Grep,Glob,WebFetch,WebSearch
       --strict-mcp-config
       --setting-sources project
       --disable-slash-commands
       --no-session-persistence
       --include-partial-messages
       --json-schema <findings schema>
       < prompt
```

- `--permission-mode auto` so a headless run never blocks on a permission prompt.
  **Not `dontAsk`, which was measured and is wrong here.** `dontAsk` denies anything that would have
  prompted, and revmux passes no `--allowedTools`, so every Bash call an agent makes is refused —
  including the `git diff` the whole design depends on, since `CLAUDE.md` has agents run diff commands
  themselves. The agent does not fail: it says "Bash is denied in this mode" and reads files instead,
  so a diff-scoped review silently becomes a whole-tree review with the delta guessed. Measured
  directly: `dontAsk` with no allowlist denies, `auto` allows.
- **The three context-trimming flags exist to cut what a reviewer carries before it reads anything**,
  and they reach only this child — a developer's own interactive claude session is untouched.
  `--tools` filters the built-in tool set down to the six a reviewer uses.
  `--strict-mcp-config` with **no** `--mcp-config` drops every MCP server the user configured, along
  with the connect time each agent spent on them; no shipped prompt names an MCP tool.
  `--setting-sources project` drops the user and local `settings.json` layers.
  **How much each saves is a property of the config, not of the flag**, so do not carry a per-flag
  breakdown here — on a config with no MCP servers the middle one saves nothing at all.
  One headline number, reproducible: 54,814 prompt tokens to 38,322 on the revmux tree, this machine's
  config, claude 2.1.260, 2026-09-04.
  **`--setting-sources` does less than its name suggests**: it selects `settings.json` layers, and a
  `CLAUDE.md` is a memory file rather than a setting, so the agent still loads both the project and the
  user one. That is most of what remains after the trim.
  **`--tools` is variadic, so it must be passed as one argv element.** `--tools A,B` followed by a
  positional swallows the positional; revmux sends the prompt on stdin, so nothing is exposed today,
  and the `=` form is what keeps it that way. `--setting-sources` takes a single value and needs none.
  **The floor this sets is claude 2.1.162.** Below it, `Grep` and `Glob` named in `--tools` are silently
  ignored on native builds, so a reviewer runs without them and nothing reports it. An unrecognised flag
  is the loud case instead — exit 1 before any model call, which degrades through the normal path.
- **`--setting-sources project` also decides what the child stops inheriting, and that is the part someone
  debugging a reviewer needs.** The user layer carries `model`, `effortLevel`, `env`, `sandbox`,
  `permissions`, `hooks` and `enabledPlugins`, and none of them reach the agent now.
  A roster entry with a bare `claude` runner therefore gets the CLI's own default model and effort
  rather than the user's saved ones. Every shipped profile names both explicitly, so shipped reviews are
  unaffected, and `manifest.json` records requested against actual either way.
  **`env` is the exception, and which way it falls depends on how revmux was launched.** The flag drops
  the user layer's `env` *block*, but a variable already in revmux's own process environment is
  inherited: `proc.childEnv` passes everything through but `CLAUDECODE` and, unless
  `--preserve-anthropic-api-key` is set, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; `--setting-sources` selects settings
  layers rather than the environment. So a model alias remap like
  `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` still reaches the child on the **headless** path, where a Claude Code
  session has already promoted its own settings `env` into the environment revmux inherits — measured on
  this machine. On the **overlay** path it does not: `launch-revmux.sh` runs revmux under `/usr/bin/env`
  with an explicit variable list, from a backend whose environment predates the user's shell.
  A maintainer reading an unexpected `actual_model` in `manifest.json` needs that split; the flag alone
  does not explain it.
  **`apiKeyHelper` has no such route** — it is a settings key rather than a variable, so the user layer's
  copy is dropped on both paths. A setup whose headless authentication lives only there loses it.
- The allowlist is what removes the edit tools from the agent's context — revmux never modifies source —
  and it removes `Task`, so a reviewer cannot fan out into subagents of its own.
  There is no `--disallowedTools`: naming `Edit,Write` in a denylist beside an allowlist that omits them
  states the same thing twice.
  This is best-effort, not a sandbox; the prompt must state the constraint too, and every shipped
  profile and stage prompt does.
  **Do not add a `--disallowedTools` Bash denylist beside the allowlist.**
  `auto` was measured allowing `echo ... > main.go` and `rm -f main.go` to delete a tracked file, so
  the exposure is real — but a shell can write through a redirect, which is syntax rather than a
  command and cannot be denied by name at all, so a Bash denylist buys a fraction of a guarantee while
  costing real capability. `Bash(sed:*)` was tried and reverted: `sed -n '10,20p'` is an ordinary
  read-only way to print a range, and denying it takes investigation away to stop nothing.
  The read-only guarantee here rests on the prompt and on the agent having no reason to write.
  Anything stronger needs a read-only checkout, which is a different design.
- `--disable-slash-commands` prevents a lens agent invoking a skill that spawns its own subagent,
  which would put an agent inside the agent.
  The call site cannot prevent that any other way — it is a property of the invoked skill, not of the caller.
- `--no-session-persistence` avoids leaving one saved transcript per lens per run.
- **`--include-partial-messages` is armour for the idle watchdog, not something revmux decodes.**
  Without it the `StructuredOutput` tool call reaches stdout as a single line written only once it is
  complete, so a large answer means minutes with no byte on either pipe while the agent is working —
  measured killing synthesis twice at exactly 120.2s as it merged 39 findings, then failing the run.
  With it the tool input arrives as `content_block_delta`/`input_json_delta` chunks throughout, which
  is the one liveness signal that window has: the narration contract cannot reach inside a tool call
  the model is still composing, so no prompt wording closes this.
  The decoder needs no case for the new `stream_event` type and must not grow one — the touch is on
  raw bytes in `teeReader.Read`, and `parseStream`'s switch ignoring an unknown type is what keeps the
  deltas out of the log. The cost is archive size, and it is not small: measured at 80-84% growth per
  agent tee, where the deltas are 44-46% of the file. Most of it is `thinking_delta`, which carries
  plaintext reaching the tee through this flag alone — the assistant blocks arrive with `thinking` empty
  and only a `signature` — and the rest is every byte of text and tool input carried a second time
  under roughly 130 bytes of JSON wrapper per chunk.
- The prompt goes in on **stdin**, never as an argv positional.
  Windows `cmd.exe` caps a command line at 8191 characters and a composed lens prompt blows past that instantly.

### Child environment

- **Always strip `CLAUDECODE` from the child environment.**
  revmux is often launched from inside an AI coding session, so the variable is inherited
  and the child refuses to start as a nested session.
  There is no case where passing it through is correct.
- Strip `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default so the child uses the interactive subscription auth rather than per-token billing.
  Expose a `--preserve-anthropic-api-key` escape hatch for users who authenticate by API key.
- Never pass `--bare`. It forces API-key auth and skips project-instruction discovery,
  which changes billing and strips the project context every lens agent depends on.

### Idle timeout and hard timeout

Two independent timers catching two different failures.

- **Idle timeout** is the one that matters: derive a cancellable context, arm `time.AfterFunc(idleTimeout, cancel)`,
  and reset it on **every output line** through a touch closure passed into the stream parser.
  When the derived context is canceled but the parent context is alive, that is an idle timeout, not an error —
  set `Result.IdleTimedOut` so the caller can retry rather than fail the run.
- **Every source of life touches it — stdout, stderr and the rollout.** None of the three is noise.
  Codex writes stdout only when it answers, and a modern one streams no reasoning on stderr either: on
  a long review both pipes are silent for minutes while only its rollout file moves. A watchdog missing
  any of the three kills a healthy codex run at the idle timeout, retries it into the same wall, and
  degrades the source that was working. Observed for stdout-only, then observed again for pipes-only.
  The touches are serialized against each other: stdout is read on the calling goroutine, stderr in its
  own, and the rollout tail in a third, so a `Timer` implementation is not required to tolerate
  concurrent callers.
  The hard timeout is what bounds a process that chatters forever without answering.
  Claude has two sources rather than three, and its blind window is its answer rather than its
  reasoning: see `--include-partial-messages` above, which is what fills it.
- **Hard timeout** is a plain `context.WithTimeout` over the whole call,
  catching the slow-but-alive case where the agent keeps emitting output forever.
- Both default to disabled at the executor level; the composition root sets them from config when it builds
  each executor. Not the pipeline — it never constructs one, it receives an injected factory.
- **Draining stderr outlives the line reader that consumes it.**
  A read fault or a line past `maxLineBytes` ends `bufio.Scanner` for good, and returning from the drain
  goroutine there leaves the pipe unread — which fills, blocks the child mid-write, and hangs the stdout
  parse until a timeout kills a run that was working.
  The remainder is copied to `io.Discard` instead: liveness is gone with the scanner, so the run rides on
  the stdout tick and the two timeouts, but the child keeps moving.
  A canceled run skips it — the process group is already being torn down and the pipe closes with it.
- **Both timers come from an injected clock, never from `time.AfterFunc` directly.**
  `.claude/rules/testing.md` forbids wall-clock waits in tests, and an idle-timeout test that actually sleeps
  is either slow or flaky. A recorded fixture that simply ends is EOF, not a stall — proving the watchdog
  fires needs a fake runner that emits fixture bytes and then blocks until cancellation, plus a clock the
  test advances itself.

### Display width belongs to the renderers

The decoder emits text; how much of it fits is decided where the terminal width is known. `textLimit`
is a sanity bound against a pathological block, not a column count.

**Both renderers clip, and that is what makes this safe.** `app/ui` clips through lipgloss against the
width bubbletea reports; `app/progress.go` has no such width reported to it, so it measures the terminal
itself — `COLUMNS` first, then `term.GetSize` on its own writer, then a fallback for a redirected
stderr. Without that half, moving the cut out of the decoder just replaces a bad truncation with an
unbounded line on stderr.

Cutting in the decoder destroys what no renderer can recover: a Bash command lost its tail at a
constant 60 columns however wide the terminal was, and an assistant block cut at its first line lost
everything after a lead-in — a closing summary reduced to "Summary of what I checked and found:".
A multi-line block is therefore **flattened**, not truncated, since an event is one line by
construction. The one deliberate exception is `rolloutTitle`, which keeps only the first line because
some codex versions append a whole paragraph after the bold title.

**Thinking is not progress and is never emitted.** The blocks arrive with `thinking` empty and only a
`signature`, so a bare "thinking" line reported nothing at all while taking a line of the log. It
existed as a heartbeat for a stream with no other sign of life; the narration contract is what fills
that role now.

### Exit codes are not log lines

`exit 0` is emitted nowhere. The pipeline emits its own done event carrying what the agent actually
produced, and a bare "exit 0" beside it is the last thing a reader sees under an agent that just
finished — pure noise in the one position that should carry the outcome.
Only a non-zero exit emits `EventFinished`, where the code is the point.

That makes the event's absence meaningful, so a test asserting anything about reaping order needs a
failing process to have something to order against. The `fail` helper mode exists for that.

### Process groups

- Set `SysProcAttr{Setsid: true}` **before** `cmd.Start()`.
  `Setsid` (not just `Setpgid`) fully detaches the child from the controlling terminal,
  preventing SIGTTIN/SIGTTOU from stopping the child's process group when a descendant touches terminal I/O.
- Kill the whole **process group** (`-pid`), SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL after a short grace delay.
  Killing only the direct child leaves node subagents and MCP servers orphaned, and they accumulate across a run.
- Kill on normal exit too, not only on cancellation — that is what reaps the orphans.
- Return early on `ESRCH` from SIGTERM so a normal exit does not pay the grace sleep on every call.
- Guard both the wait and the kill with `sync.Once`; the wait must be safe to call repeatedly.

### Shared base, thin executors

`Claude`, `Codex` and `Kimi` all need the same run loop, idle watchdog, process-group teardown and line reader.
Duplicating that gives two near-identical `Run` bodies, which `dupl` will fail in lint.

Put the shared machinery on an unexported `proc` struct that each embeds.
Each executor supplies only its own `args()` and its own output parsing.
Model and effort belong on the **per-run request**, not on construction-time options —
a single executor instance has to serve roster entries with different models.

### Raw output belongs to the caller, not just the parser

`Request` carries an optional `RawOutput io.Writer`, and `proc` tees every byte to it **before** parsing.

Without this the archive cannot do its job. Raw stdout is consumed inside `proc` and the per-executor
parsers, so a caller holding only parsed events can never reconstruct byte-identical claude stream-json or
codex prose. Re-serializing parsed events is not the same artifact: a reflection agent reading a paraphrase
of what the model emitted is worse off than one with no data, because it cannot tell the difference.

Tee before parse, not after — a stream that fails to parse is exactly the one worth having on disk.

### Codex differences

Codex is a peer executor, not a special case in the pipeline — but the executor itself is genuinely different.

- **Codex has no `stream-json` equivalent, and its stdout stays empty until it answers.**
  A review agent spends minutes reading and reasoning with not one byte on stdout, so anything watching
  that stream alone shows a banner and then nothing for the whole review.
  Assistant text and tool dispatch land only in its session rollout file, whose path derives from a session id
  printed in the stderr header banner. `app/executor/rollout.go` tails it: stderr is mined for the id and
  nothing else, the file is found by globbing `~/.codex/sessions/*/*/*/rollout-*-<id>.jsonl`, and the tail
  outlives the process so the last reasoning step and the answer are not lost.
  Never parse stderr prose for activity — that is what the rollout exists to spare.
- **The glob repeats on every pass; a single look at the banner is a race, and it loses.**
  Codex prints `session id:` *before* it creates the rollout — measured at 32ms between the two — so the
  tail is asked for a file that is not there yet. Returning at that first miss made a codex source silent
  for an entire eleven-minute review while its rollout filled beside it with 28 reasoning records and 12
  tool calls, and one silent source is indistinguishable from a codex that never worked.
  The tail therefore keeps looking until the run's context ends. Nothing is lost by finding the file a
  poll interval late: the read starts at offset zero, so the records written before it was found are
  still reported.
  A test for this must assert the tail has **not** returned before the file is created. Asserting only
  that the records eventually arrive races the test's own write against the tail's first glob, and a
  single-glob tail passes whenever the write wins — which is most of the time. That test was written
  that way first and let the reverted code through.
- **Take reasoning from `response_item`/`reasoning` only.**
  Codex writes an `event_msg`/`agent_reasoning` record for the same step as well, so handling both reports
  every step twice. Only the first line of a summary is used: some versions append a whole paragraph after
  the bold title, and forwarding it reintroduces the flood the rollout is read to avoid.
- **A shell tool call whose command cannot be recovered is dropped, not reported by name.**
  `exec`, `exec_command` and `shell` carry the command in the payload, so the name on its own says only
  that codex called a tool. Most calls yield a command — `arguments` carries `cmd`, or `cmdPattern`
  matches it out of a `custom_tool_call`'s snippet — but codex composes some multi-command snippets as a
  JS array with no `cmd` key at all, and those left a bare `exec` in the activity column for minutes.
  Every other tool keeps the name fallback: `apply_patch` and `update_plan` name what the agent is doing.
  Dropping is safe because liveness never rode on these events — the tail touches the idle timer whenever
  the file advances, never from the sink, and a codex leader releases the stagger gate on its first raw
  stdout write.
- **Codex has no `--json-schema`.**
  The executor appends its own "return only JSON matching this shape" contract to the composed prompt,
  rendering `Request.Schema` inline. That field is set for **both** executors and carries the running
  stage's schema, so a codex entry running synthesis or verify asks for that stage's shape.
  Hardcoding a finder-shaped contract here breaks the moment a profile resolves a stage onto codex.
  The wrapper text lives in the executor, never in a lens file, which must stay executor-agnostic.
- The idle watchdog ticks on raw stdout writes rather than parsed events, **on stderr lines, and on
  rollout records**. All three, and the third is not optional.
  A modern codex streams no reasoning on stderr at all: during a long review both pipes are silent for
  minutes while the rollout fills with the steps it is working through. A watchdog reading only the
  pipes kills a healthy run at the idle timeout, retries it into the same wall and degrades the source
  that was working — observed doing exactly that, with both tees zero bytes and the rollout showing
  the agent reasoning two minutes before it was killed.
  `proc` cannot see the rollout, so `runSpec.shareTouch` hands the touch out and the tail calls it
  **whenever the file advances** — never from the sink.
  Touching from the sink ties liveness to the display filter: a `function_call_output`, an `event_msg`
  or a reasoning record with an empty summary all move the file without producing an event, so codex
  could be demonstrably working and still starve the timer.
  The touch reaches the tail through an atomic, because the tail starts before `proc.run` exists to
  hand it over; the goroutine blocks on the session id first, so it is always stored before anything
  is read.
  **`Codex.Run` withdraws it before canceling the tail, and that order is the fix — not a comment on
  the final pass.** `run` stops the idle timer on its way out while the tail is still looping, so the
  pass at the top of that loop can otherwise re-arm a timer belonging to a finished run. Suppressing
  the touch only on the tail's own last pass leaves that window wide open.
  **A test must pin both directions of the advance guard.** Asserting only that the timer *is* reset
  passes a tail that touches on every poll — and a watchdog fed by its own polling never fires at all,
  which is invisible from outside. An empty rollout gives the negative case with no timing at all.
  A test for this must isolate the rollout as the only possible source of a reset — empty stdout and a
  single stderr line — or the pipes' own touches drown the signal and it passes with the wiring removed.
- Extraction must tolerate JSON wrapped in surrounding prose; finding no JSON is a degraded source, not a crash.
- Codex stderr is noisy — startup banner, exec echo, hook lifecycle lines, reasoning stream.
  Forward at most the resolved `model:` / `sandbox:` / `reasoning effort:` header lines, once per process, and suppress the rest.
  **Those go out as `EventInfo`, never `EventActivity`**: the banner prints before codex has contacted a
  model, and `EventActivity` is what releases the pipeline's stagger gate. See `.claude/rules/pipeline.md`.
  Once per process is a `seen` map keyed on the header name, not a position check:
  codex reprints the banner in some runs, and the guard is what makes "once" true.
  **stderr drains in its own goroutine alongside the stdout parse**, so where a forwarded header lands
  relative to the stdout events is unspecified — assert that a repeated header is forwarded once, never that
  it arrives at a particular index. A test doing the latter is flaky by construction and was.
- The resolved `model:` header is also where codex's actual model comes from, since there is no `result`
  event to read it off.
- **The `tokens used` footer on stderr is the run's token count, for the same reason** — there is no usage
  object anywhere else, and leaving it unread reports every codex source as having spent nothing.
  The marker and the number are separate lines, so the marker arms the read and a non-numeric line disarms it:
  codex echoes the whole prompt to stderr, and a lens body carrying those two words must not become a total.
  **Disarming alone is not enough, because an echoed prompt can carry the marker and a number on consecutive lines**,
  and a run that then fails never prints the real footer to overwrite it — so the failed attempt would be charged
  for whatever number the prompt happened to contain.
  The footer is the last thing codex prints, so the count is only reported when nothing followed it once stderr
  has drained. The last footer still wins; a count with content after it is treated as echo and dropped.
- Plan-quota errors arrive on **stderr with an empty stdout**, so a stdout-only error check misses them entirely.
  Only lines prefixed `error:` are read as diagnostics — that prefix gate is what keeps a reasoning stream
  discussing a rate limit from being mistaken for one.
  **The last such line wins, not the first**, for the same reason the token footer does:
  the echoed prompt precedes everything codex reports itself, so a first-match diagnostic names a line the
  prompt quoted — a lens body, a finding describing an error — as the failure,
  and hands `classify` a line that can carry a limit pattern the run never hit.
- `--sandbox` comes from the `codex-sandbox` knob and defaults to `read-only`; revmux itself never asks an
  agent to write. `danger-full-access` exists for a container that is the isolation boundary: codex's
  bubblewrap sandbox needs user namespaces, and without them every command fails before it runs while the
  agent still returns schema-valid empty findings.
- Always start `codex exec` with `--skip-git-repo-check`: exec otherwise refuses to start outside a Git
  repository, and revmux has no VCS dependency.
  The check ignores project trust, as verified in Codex 0.146.0's
  [`exec-lib.rs` (`codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs`)](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.146.0/codex-rs/exec/src/lib.rs#L790-L799).

### Kimi differences

Measured against Kimi Code CLI 2.1.1 on 2026-09-29, from its print-mode emitter (`PromptJsonWriter` and
`dispatchNativeEvent` inside the bundled `kimi.exe`, `grep -a -n PromptJsonWriter` finds them), real failed
runs, and the session logs of real successful ones on the recording machine.
No successful stream could be recorded while the account was over its usage limit, which is why
`testdata/kimi-clean.jsonl` is the one hand-built fixture and `testdata/README.md` says so.

- **The prompt goes in argv, because print mode has no other input.** `kimi -p <prompt>` is the only way
  in; a blank one is refused with `Prompt cannot be empty.` `runSpec.promptInArgv` leaves stdin empty, and
  kimi was verified exiting normally on an empty stdin rather than waiting on it.
  **Argv survives the round trip intact on Windows**, verified directly: a 20,011-character prompt holding
  double quotes, lone and trailing backslashes, `\"`, backticks, tabs, newlines, `%VAR%`, `^`, `&`, `|`
  and non-ASCII text went through Go's `exec.Command` and was recorded by kimi, in the session's
  `wire.jsonl` `turn.prompt` record, byte for byte identical. A quota-failed run still writes that record,
  so this can be re-checked without spending anything.
  **Windows caps the whole command line at 32,767 UTF-16 units**, and CreateProcess reports going over as
  an opaque "filename or extension is too long". `checkWindowsCmdLine` measures the line the way
  `os/exec` builds it and refuses it before start, naming both numbers. A finder prompt is far below it,
  since composition embeds paths rather than content; a stage prompt inlines every finding and is not,
  which is why the shipped kimi profiles keep synthesis and verify on claude.
- **Never pass `--auto`, `--yolo` or `--plan`.** Print mode sets permission mode `auto` itself, and the
  CLI refuses `--prompt` beside any of the three. There is no tool allowlist flag, so a kimi reviewer keeps
  its edit and subagent tools: the read-only guarantee rests on the prompt alone, as it does for claude.
- **stream-json is OpenAI-message-shaped JSON lines**:
  `{"role":"meta","type":"system.version"}` first, before any model call;
  `{"role":"assistant","content":…,"tool_calls":[{"function":{"name","arguments"}}]}` once per model step;
  `{"role":"tool","tool_call_id","content"}` per tool result;
  `{"role":"meta","type":"turn.step.retrying",…}` when kimi retries a step itself;
  `{"role":"meta","type":"session.resume_hint"}` last on success.
  There is no result object, no usage and no model, so `ActualModel` and `Tokens` stay empty rather than
  estimated. Both exist only in the session's `wire.jsonl`, whose directory is named by the last line.
  The version banner must emit nothing: it prints before any model call, and an output-shaped event there
  releases the stagger gate on a process that has done nothing.
- **One model step is silent on every channel kimi writes, and that is what `kimi-idle-timeout` is for.**
  The writer buffers a step's text and tool calls and flushes them when the step ends; thinking deltas are
  dropped outright (`writeThinkingDelta() {}`); stderr carries only tool progress text; and `wire.jsonl`
  records thinking and text as whole blocks at step end too, so tailing it would not help.
  Measured over 159 real steps (`llm.request` to its `usage.record` in `wire.jsonl`, at
  `thinkingEffort: max`): median 11s, 90th percentile 40s, and the longest 116s, 156s, 212s, 283s and 326s.
  The long ones are the steps that write a lot, which is exactly a finder's last step, so the shared 2m
  timeout kills the answer while it is being written and the one retry meets the same wall.
  `NewKimi` therefore arms the watchdog from `Opts.KimiIdleTimeout` (6m) in place of `IdleTimeout`.
  The real fix is `kimi acp`, which streams thought and message chunks over JSON-RPC; it is a different
  protocol and has not been built.
- **The last assistant message is not reliably the answer.** A hook result is written as an assistant
  line, and after the main turn completes print mode drains background tasks and may run further turns
  before it exits, each writing assistant lines of its own. `kimiAnswer` walks the messages last to first
  and takes the first object carrying every top-level key the request's schema requires, falling back to
  the last message that decodes at all so the pipeline's own shape check names the mismatch.
  Each message is extracted on its own, never concatenated: an earlier status line holding a brace would
  otherwise be read as the answer.
- **Effort has no flag.** A model's supported efforts are declared in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` and set
  only there. A kimi runner's effort is accepted, reported once as ignored through `EventInfo`, and never
  passed. `kimi-mixed`'s kimi entries inherit `high` from the profile and report it; `kimi-only` names none.
- **Failure lands on stderr with only the banner on stdout.** A usage-limit run exits 1 with
  `error: failed to run prompt: provider.auth_error: 403 You've reached your 5-hour usage limit. …`.
  Tiering reads the last `error:` line alone — stdout is structured, so there is no prose tail to consult,
  and a finding that discusses a 503 must not be read as one. The one retry the pipeline makes cannot
  succeed against a five-hour limit; it is still reported as a limit rather than as anything else.
- The binary is `kimi-bin` when it names anything but the bare `kimi`, then `kimi` on `PATH`, then
  `~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi[.exe]`, where the installer writes it without always adding it to `PATH`.
  `preflight.sh` resolves it the same way, or it would report a working install as missing.

### Error and limit patterns

claude gets its rate-limit signal from the typed `rate_limit_event`, so string matching is only needed for codex
and kimi.
Where patterns are used, tier them: **retry → limit → error**.

- Retry tier covers transient server hiccups: `API Error: 529`, `502`, `503`, `504`.
  `500` is deliberately excluded — it can be a deterministic failure and belongs in the error tier.
- **Never match patterns against the whole output.**
  A review agent's findings text will literally contain the words "rate limit" and "API Error"
  when it is reviewing code that handles rate limits — including this project's own code.
  Check only the tail, and only when the process exited non-zero.
- Skip pattern checks entirely when the context was canceled — a canceled run's tail is meaningless.

### Cross-platform

- Platform-specific code goes in `foo_unix.go` (`//go:build !windows`) and `foo_windows.go` (`//go:build windows`).
- Methods split across build-tagged files are fine, so platform code does not force standalone helpers.
- Windows has no process groups; the stub kills the direct process only, and that is an accepted limitation.
- Verify with `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build ./...` before shipping anything touching this package.

### Capturing real streams for fixtures

To learn what the upstream CLIs actually emit, do not launch `claude` or `codex` from an AI agent's own tool shell —
nested launches are commonly blocked by the host tool's permission layer, and the capture silently fails.
Run the capture in a separate, independent terminal session, redirect stdout and stderr to files, and inspect those.
Recorded captures belong in `app/executor/testdata/` as fixtures; see `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
