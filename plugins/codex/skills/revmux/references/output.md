# Reading what revmux returns

The report goes to **stdout**, JSON by default or markdown with `--markdown`. Nothing else is written
to stdout, so `revmux --task pr-123 > findings.json` is safe with the TUI running.

Prefer JSON when a model consumes it. Use `--markdown` only for output going straight to a human.

**Never `2>&1` into the report file** — stderr is the progress renderer and makes the JSON unparseable.

## The JSON shape

```json
{
  "scope": {"task": "pr-123", "run": "02-after-fix",
            "scope_path": "/abs/.revmux/tasks/pr-123/02-after-fix/input/scope.md"},
  "sources": {
    "expected": 4, "reported": 3, "degraded": ["docs+tests"],
    "agents": [
      {"name": "bugs+impl", "lenses": ["bugs", "impl"], "executor": "claude",
       "requested_model": "opus", "actual_model": "claude-opus-5",
       "effort": "high", "tokens": 48210, "raised": 6, "degraded": false}
    ]
  },
  "findings": [
    {"id": "f1", "file": "app/pipeline/find.go", "line": 88, "end_line": 0,
     "severity": "major", "confidence": 90,
     "title": "…", "body": "…", "fix": "…",
     "sources": ["bugs+impl", "adversarial"], "lenses": ["bugs", "adversarial"],

    "duration_ms": 333000, "tokens": 184920,
    "stages": [{"name": "find", "duration_ms": 201000},

  }
}
```

Empty lists are arrays, never `null`.

## Check `sources` before reading `findings`

A degraded run looks like a clean one: the findings list is genuinely shorter and nothing in it says why.

```
sources.expected          how many sources the roster called for
sources.reported          how many returned findings
sources.degraded          names of the ones that did not
sources.agents[].raised   how many each returned, before any stage filtered them
```

`expected != reported` means partial. Lead with it, name the degraded sources, and treat "no findings"
as inconclusive rather than clean. Offer to re-run.

Every source degrading exits `2` — a tool error, not a clean empty report.

**`raised: 0` on a source that is not degraded is the other way a run comes back thin, and it does not
show up in any of the three counts above.** An agent whose tools are broken answers `{"findings": []}`,
which is a valid answer, so it reports as healthy and lands in `reported`. Say so when you see it rather
than presenting the run as complete — and in a triage it is worth more than a mention, since a panelist
that built no case is either agreeing there is nothing to say or was never able to look. The archive
settles which: the round's `agents/<name>.*` tee is a few bytes when it could not work.

`requested_model` vs `actual_model`: `claude --model` can be silently ignored, so a model pin is a
claim until read back. A mismatch does not invalidate the review but explains a shallow one.

## Findings

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable within this report |
| `file`, `line`, `end_line` | `end_line` `0` = single line; `line` `0` = file-level |
| `severity` | `critical`, `major`, `minor` |
| `confidence` | 0-100, already filtered by `--min-confidence` |
| `title` | the claim, one line |
| `body` | the argument — trigger and consequence |
| `fix` | the suggested change |
| `sources` | **agent names** that raised it |
| `lenses` | **lens names** it was raised under |
| `verdict` | verify's judgment |

### `sources` and `lenses` are not interchangeable

`sources` holds agent names and is the only input to the cross-source confidence boost. **A source is
a process** — an agent carrying two lenses that flags the same issue under both is still one source.

`lenses` is informational: why it was reported, never how many independently agreed.

Two entries in `sources` is the strongest signal in the report. Two in `lenses` with one in `sources`
is not.

Go stamps `sources` after parsing; no schema exposes it to the model.

### Verdicts

| verdict | how to treat it |
|---|---|
| `confirmed` | act on it |
| `refined` | act on it; the body is the corrected version |
| `rejected` | do not act on it |
| `immaterial` | do not act on it; report it separately so the dismissal can be audited |
| `pre_existing` | report separately, not this change's responsibility |
| `unverified` | verify was skipped; every finding is unchecked, say so |

`immaterial` and `pre_existing` move out of `findings` into their own top-level lists. `rejected` gets no
list — a finding the verifier judged not real is dropped, and only the stage snapshots in the archive
still hold it.

## The other lists

- `open_questions` — questions for the author, not defects. Often where the real problem is.
- `pre_existing` — report as a separate section so the author is not asked to fix unrelated things.
- `immaterial` — real, and judged not worth acting on. Report it as its own short section and keep it out
  of the actionable count. It is where a wrong dismissal hides, and the reader is the only one who can
  catch one.

## Reporting to a human

`references/present.md` is the whole of it — the order of the turn, how much of a body to show, the
decision block and the question. This file says what the fields mean; that one says what to do with
them, and it is the only place the shape of the turn is defined.

## A triage report reads differently

Under `--profile triage` the same JSON carries a panel's arguments about a filed item rather than defects
in a diff. Four things change in how it is read, and `references/triage.md` is the procedure around them.

- **`severity` means weight on the decision**, not damage. `critical` is decisive on its own, `major`
  bears strongly, `minor` is worth knowing and does not move the answer. A point can be entirely true and
  still be `minor`.
- **`file` is usually empty**, and that is correct: most of what a panel reports cites a comment in the
  thread, a comparable item or a stated rule rather than a line of code. An argument citing nothing at
  all is a hunch, whatever its confidence says.
- **Never branch on the exit code.** `1` means findings were reported and `0` means none survived, but a
  triage run reaches `0` by routes a code review does not. Read `findings` and report what is in it.
- **Cross-source corroboration means little here.** Four agents given four different parts of one
  argument are not expected to overlap, so two names in `sources` is a curiosity rather than the
  strongest signal in the report.

**A triage run needs `--no-synthesis`, and its absence is silent.** Every argument a panel raises is
single-source by construction, so the drop rule eats the minor-weight ones wholesale and the confidence
boost fires where two agents *told to disagree* happen to agree. The report that comes back still looks
like a report. This holds on a second round as much as the first.

## The run archive

Every artifact lands in the round directory — the `round_dir` `revmux new` reported — beside the
`input/` the round was reviewed against:

```
02-after-fix/
├── input/                    the scope, goal, profile and context this round was reviewed against
├── manifest.json             roster, prompt provenance + hashes, requested vs actual model, timings
├── prompts/
│   ├── agents/               composed prompt per agent, post-substitution
│   ├── stages/               synthesis.md, verify-<group>.md
│   └── input-profile.md      the project profile's bytes, when the round inherited one
├── stages/
│   ├── 1-found.json
│   ├── 2-synthesized.json
│   └── 3-verified.json       absent when the stage was skipped
├── events.jsonl              stalls, retries, degrades, stage transitions
├── agents/
│   ├── bugs+impl.jsonl       claude or kimi stream-json
│   ├── bugs+impl.retry.jsonl second attempt when one was retried
│   └── codex.log             codex prose
├── report.md
└── findings.json
```

A round read on its own shows both what was reviewed and what came back.

Both `report.md` and `findings.json` are always written, whichever renderer went to stdout. This is
the recovery path when a run's stdout was lost.

| question | file |
|---|---|
| why did this agent report nothing? | `agents/<name>.jsonl` |
| did an agent stall or get retried? | `events.jsonl`, plus a `<name>.retry.jsonl` |
| did synthesis drop something real? | the `dropped` event in `events.jsonl` — it carries the findings themselves |
| did verify reject wrongly? | `stages/2-synthesized.json` vs `3-verified.json` |
| what was this agent asked? | `prompts/agents/<name>.md` |
| which lens text, from which layer? | `manifest.json` |
| what calibrated this round? | `input/profile.md`, or `prompts/input-profile.md` when it inherited the project's |

A failed archive write fails the run. The exception is a per-agent tee, which degrades that source.

`manifest.json` also marks the round as run: revmux refuses to reuse a round that finished. It is
created empty when the run starts and filled in when it ends, so a round holding an **empty** one was
claimed by a review that never came back. That round is still open, and re-running it under the same
`--run` name is the way to recover it — but only while the dead review wrote nothing else into it. A
round that already holds `stages/`, `agents/`, `prompts/`, `events.jsonl` or a report is refused under
its own name, because a second run there would leave one round holding two runs' artifacts. Nothing is
deleted to make it usable: open the next round and copy the `input/` across. A directory with no
`manifest.json` at all is a round prepared but never reviewed.

Nothing removes a round as a side effect of a review. Reclaiming space is `revmux cleanup --task <id>`,
which takes a whole task and is refused while a running review holds one of its rounds.

## The plain progress renderer

With `--no-tui`, events render as timestamped lines on **stderr**:

```
16:02:11 bugs+impl: started [bugs, impl]
16:02:19 arch+quality: tool: Grep
16:04:02 docs+tests: retrying: agent docs+tests stalled
16:05:12 bugs+impl: done, 6 findings
16:05:40 stage synthesis
```

`tail -f` on this file is what a user watches during a headless run. Read its tail plus
`events.jsonl` to answer a status request; do not guess.
