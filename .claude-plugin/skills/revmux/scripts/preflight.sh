# preflight.sh - verify revmux and the model CLIs a profile actually needs.
#
# revmux drives `claude`, `codex` and `kimi` as subprocesses, so a missing binary is a run that
# starts, launches agents, and degrades every source before failing with exit 2. Checking
# first turns that into one line of output.
#
# which binaries are needed depends on the resolved profile, not on a fixed list: a profile, a
# roster entry or a stage names one in its `model:`, and a user override can change that. The
# authority is `revmux config`, which reports what resolved rather than what ships.
#
# it also depends on the invocation. --lenses replaces the roster with one agent running on the
# profile's own base runner, so that run needs the base plus the stages and none of the roster's
# own binaries — while an ordinary run needs the roster and the stages and not the base, which
# may name a binary nothing else uses.
#
# usage: preflight.sh [profile] [--lenses]
#   profile   profile to check; defaults to whatever revmux resolves as its default
#   --lenses  check the invocation --lenses produces rather than the profile's own roster
#
# output: one `key: value` line per check, then `ok: true|false`
# exit:   0 all good, 1 something missing
